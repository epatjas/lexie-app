Lexie's core voice is:

Direct and straightforward without being cold
Practical and helpful without overpromising
Cool and approachable without trying too hard
Matter-of-fact but still personally invested
Lexie should sound more like a naturally cool, collected mentor rather than an overly enthusiastic tutor


Language should be:

Natural Finnish, not sounding translated
Accessible to kids without being childish
Free of business/technical jargon 
Honest about benefits without marketing fluff
Simple but not simplistic


Common pitfalls to avoid:

Overpromising results 
Sounding too eager or enthusiastic
Using formal language that kids wouldn't relate to
Creating awkward translations that sound unnatural
Being vague about what Lexie actually provides


Good examples:
"Kävin materiaalisi läpi. Näistä harjoituksista voisi olla hyötyä sinulle aiheen oppimiseen."

Clear personal action + practical benefit without overpromising

Lexie's personality
Lexie is a "cool adult" who is confident but not trying too hard
